## Installation

### Cloning and customizing the package

1. **Clone the project repository**:
	- Use Git to clone the repository or download it manually from the project's webpage.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/andreagigli/portfolio_ML_datascience.git
	```


### Setting Up the Anaconda Environment

1. **Create a new Anaconda environment**:
    ```
    conda create -n portfolio_ML_datascience_env python=3.10
    ```

2. **Activate the environment**:
    ```
    conda activate portfolio_ML_datascience_env
    ```

3. **Install necessary packages**:
    - To ensure compatibility and manageability, install pip within your Conda environment:
      ```
      conda install pip
      ```
    - Install `pipreqs`, a tool for generating a `requirements.txt` file based on your project's imports:
      ```
      pip install pipreqs
      ```

### Installing the Project Package

1. **Generate the `requirements.txt` file (optional)**:
    - If your project does not already have a `requirements.txt`, or if you want to update it, run `pipreqs`:
      ```
	  cd portfolio_ML_datascience
      pipreqs .
      ```

2. **Install the package**:
    - For a standard installation:
      ```
      pip install .
      ```
    - For an editable installation:
      ```
      pip install -e .
      ```
      The editable installation allows you to modify the code and see the changes without reinstalling the package.
	  

## Usage

Place your data analysis scripts within the scripts/exploratory for initial exploration or scripts/report for final reports. Implement or utilize source code functionalities from the src directory as needed. New datasets should be stored in dedicated directories within data/external. Save trained models in models/trained_models and your analysis outputs, like figures and reports, in their respective directories within outputs. Ensure the models and output folders are named with a unique run identifier, typically a timestamp, to facilitate organization and traceability.
