def eda(*args):
    """
    Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on one or more datasets provided as arguments.

    Args:
        *args: Variable length argument list. Each argument can be a Pandas DataFrame, a series, or any
               data structure suitable for analysis. The function can also accept arguments specifying
               details about the analysis to be performed, such as column names of interest, types of
               plots to generate, or specific statistics to compute.

    Returns:
        The function's return value would typically include summaries of the analyses performed, such as
        printed output of statistical tests, matplotlib figures or seaborn plots visualizing aspects of the
        data, or even a list or dictionary summarizing key findings. The specific return type and structure
        would depend on the implementation of the EDA tasks within the function.
